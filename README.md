# Simple website for frontend tools testing

Objective of this project was to learn how to customize [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) with Sass and create custom configuration of webpack from zero. Current webpack configuration allows to compile ES6 code and Sass files, bundle them and generate files ready for deployment. In "Project" page I used NPM package [StickyBits](https://github.com/dollarshaveclub/stickybits) to stick content to it's parent div while scrolling through images.
Design inspiration was taken from [Piroll theme](https://html.nkdev.info/piroll/home-4.html)

Live version: [https://pilkas.github.io/pp/](https://pilkas.github.io/pp/)

To do:
- Integrate Font Awesome into webpack config
- Add Github deploy script
- Optimize use of Bulma modules
